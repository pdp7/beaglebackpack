# Sample code for both the RotaryEncoder class and the Switch class.
# The common pin for the encoder should be wired to ground.
# The sw_pin should be shorted to ground by the switch.

# Output looks like this:
#
#    A B STATE SEQ DELTA SWITCH
#    1 1   3    2    1    0
#    0 1   2    3    1    0
#    0 0   0    0    1    0
#    1 0   1    1    1    0
#    1 1   3    2    1    0
#    0 1   2    3    1    0
